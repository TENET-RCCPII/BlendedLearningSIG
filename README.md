# eLearning/Blended Learning SIG for SA Higher Education

This is the repository and website for the Special Interest Group that was established in 2017 by members from ASAUDIT. In 2018/2019 the [Rural Campuses Connection Project II](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/) (RCCPII) provided some funding to help develop a community of practice and specifically to include rural campuses, new universities, and universities of technology.
